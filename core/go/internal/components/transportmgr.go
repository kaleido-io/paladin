// TransportClient is the interface for a component that can receive messages from the transport manager
type TransportClient interface {
	// This function is used by the transport manager to deliver messages to the engine.
	//
	// The implementation of this function:
	// - MUST thread safe
	// - SHOULD NOT perform any processing within the function call itself beyond routing
	//
	// There is no ack to the messages. They are at-most-once delivery. So there is no error return.
	// Use it or lose it.
	//
	// The design assumption of the transport manager is that the engine is entirely responsible
	// for determining what thread-of-control to dispatch any given message to.
	// This is because the determination of that is not dependent on who it came from,
	// but rather what its purpose is.
	//
	// Most likely processing pattern is:
	// - Pick a suitable go channel for a thread-of-control that could process the message (existing or new)
	// - Push the message into that go channel
	// - Handle the situation where the go channel is full (mark a miss for that routine to go back and handle when it gets free)
	//
	// The TransportMessage wrapper for the payload contains some fields designed to help
	// an engine perform this routing to the correct channel. These can be enhanced as required, but that
	// does require change to each plugin to propagate that extra field.
	//
	// There is very limited ordering performed by the transport manager itself.
	// It delivers messages to this function:
	// - in whatever order they are received from the transport plugin(s), which is dependent on the _sender_ usually
	// - with whatever concurrency is performed by the transport plugin(s), which is commonly one per remote node, but that's not assured

	// However, how much actual I/O is performed in-line with the function call is transport plugin dependent.
	//
	// The transport tries to feedback failure when it is immediate, but the transport has no guarantees

	//
	// The message is persisted to the DB in the supplied transaction, then sent on the wire with indefinite retry
	// including over node restart, until an ack is returned from the remote node.
