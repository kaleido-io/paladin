\section{Zeto}

The Zeto privacy domain consists of a collection of privacy-preserving, UTXO-based token implementations built using zero-knowledge proofs. Each Zeto token achieves a targeted subset of security properties. If the provided token implementations satisfy the security requirements for a given use case, then they can be deployed as-is. Otherwise, they can be used as templates for implementations that achieve new combinations of security goals.

This section starts by outlining the security properties targeted by Zeto tokens. We then describe how Zeto tokens achieve these properties while ensuring correctness with zero-knowledge proofs, and we illustrate how these tokens are implemented with an example.


\subsection{Security Goals}

\paragraph{Anonymity.}

% instead of revealing input values for each input and output UTXO, we just reveal the UTXOs themselves
% UTXO == commitment (these are used interchangably in the code)
% this is like "input and output hiding"

\paragraph{Encryption of secrets} % TODO: find a better name for this

% uses poseidon encryption
% encrypts the output UTXO information: the tx value and salt for the UTXO
% No additional privacy over "anonymity". the difference is that here we store encryptions of the output UTXO values and salts on the base chain.
% don't rely on off-chain channels for receivers to get necessary secrets
% malicious sender can't hide the sent tokens from the receiver

\paragraph{History masking.}

% nullifiers hide which input UTXOs are used
% this achieves "unlinkability" of input values to outputs, while guaranteeing that valid inputs do exist

\paragraph{Know Your Customer (KYC).}

% verifies that the input user is a member of a sparse merkle tree (SMT) that holds known users

\paragraph{Non-repudiation}

% encrypts tx info (input and output owner, input and output values and salts) to be decrypted by an authority
% identical to qurrency but not post-quantum secure < ** maybe note qurrency here **


\subsection{Zero-Knowledge Proofs}

\subsubsection{Preliminaries}
% what is a zk proof
% groth16

\subsubsection{Implementation}
% snarkjs, circom


\subsection{Example Token: \texttt{anon\_nullifier\_kyc}} % we can maybe change which token this section is focused on

% show diagram of the ZK circuit
% reiterate points from "preliminaries": ZK proof ensures honest transaction generation, but only a subset of the values are revealed publicly
